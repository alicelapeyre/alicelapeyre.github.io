I am an economist at the [French Council of Economic Analysis (CAE)](https://www.cae-eco.fr/en/). 

In June 2024, I obtained my Ph.D. in Economics from [CREST](https://crest.science) under the supervision of Prof. [Roland Rathelot](http://rolandrathelot.com) (CREST/ENSAE) and Prof. [Camille Landais](https://econ.lse.ac.uk/staff/clandais/cgi-bin/index.php) (LSE). I visited the [London School of Economics](https://www.lse.ac.uk), sponsored by Prof. Camille Landais, and [UC Berkeley](https://www.econ.berkeley.edu), sponsored by Prof. Emmanuel Saez.

My research focuses on topics in labor and public economics. I am studying short-time work programs, currently investigating firms behavioral responses to economic incentives. I also study how firm adjust their labor demand to shocks.
