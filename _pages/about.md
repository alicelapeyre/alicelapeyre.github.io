I am an economist at the <b> [French Council of Economic Analysis (CAE)](https://www.cae-eco.fr/en/) <b>. 

I received my PhD in Economics from <b>[CREST](https://crest.science)<b> in 2024, supervised by Roland Rathelot (CREST/ENSAE) and Camille Landais (LSE). During my PhD, I visited the [London School of Economics](https://www.lse.ac.uk), hosted by Camille Landais, and [UC Berkeley](https://www.econ.berkeley.edu), hosted by Emmanuel Saez.

My research focuses on topics in labor and public economics. I am studying short-time work programs, currently investigating firms behavioral responses to economic incentives. I also study how firm adjust their labor demand to shocks. 

**Research interests**: Public Economics, Labour Economics, Applied Econometrics

 My CV is available [here](https://github.com/alicelapeyre/alicelapeyre.github.io/raw/master/files/ALapeyre_CV.pdf).
