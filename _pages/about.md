I am a **Senior Economist** at the **[French Council of Economic Analysis (CAE)](https://www.cae-eco.fr/en/)**, where I lead quantitative analyses on employment, productivity and innovation, and social insurance. I manage research teams and coordinate projects with academic partners. I advise ministers and senior advisors through data-driven insights and recommendations. I author policy reports and support media outreach.

Ongoing projects include : 
- Rethinking unemployment insurance, with François Fontaine, Roland Rathelot, and Alexandra Roulet.
- Productivity and innovation (AI), with Antonin Bergeaud, Simon Bunel, and Xavier Jaravel. 
    
I received my **Ph.D. in Economics** from CREST-IP Paris in 2024, supervised by Camille Landais (LSE) and Roland Rathelot (CREST-IP Paris). During my Ph.D., I visited the London School of Economics, sponsored by Camille Landais and UC Berkeley, sponsored by Emmanuel Saez.

**Research fields**: Public Economics, Labour Economics, Applied Econometrics
